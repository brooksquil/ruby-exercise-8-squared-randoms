Instructions

Using the Random class, generate a list of 20 random numbers between 0 and 49.
prng = Random.new

random_numbers = [...insert awesome code here...]
puts(random_numbers)
With the resulting array, build a new array that contains each number squared. For example, if the original list is [2, 5], the final list will be [4, 25].
